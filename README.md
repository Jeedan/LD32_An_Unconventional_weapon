First time ludum dare!

Game is called "Clean Killings". It is kind of a stick shootery / diablo game. 
The main character gets tasked to clean out the cellar by his boss. He is an intern.
The objective is to use a broom, vacuum cleaner and a flamethrower to clean the cellar of rodents, spiders and dirt.

This was a 72hr game jam, my first one so it is pretty rough...
