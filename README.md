# LD32_An_Unconventional_weapon
First time ludum dare!

Game is called "Clean Killings". It is kind of a stick shootery / diablo game. 
The main character gets tasked to clean out the cellar by his boss. He is an intern.
The objective is to use a broom, vacuum cleaner and a flamethrower to clean the cellar of rodents, spiders and dirt.

This was a 72hr game jam, my first one so it is pretty rough...

First of the Controls:
== WASD to move ==
== Left click to attack ==
== Player looks at mouse == 
== To exit, die and click on Quit/ or close the browser == 

Description of the Game:
You are an intern at a mysterious store that sells weapons. However the boss has a dungeon filled with monster rats and spiders and no weapons in sight...except for a broom and a vacuum cleaner?(wave 5). Perhaps the boss only wanted to feed his pets...muhahahah

The game's UI and mechanics are based on Dark Souls... You can never win and each time you die you spawn right back to continue killing...forever.

Post Mortem:
This is my first game jam and I really needed to participate in this.
My main purpose was to get something finished, in a reasonable time frame. As you will see, the theme itself was not important to me this time around but I will focus on that more during the next Ludum Dares, as I will force myself to participate in as many as possible as this was super fun.

Sorry for the art, I am a programmer, which doesn't say much but eeeehhh I have no skills in designing.

I began working on this project maybe 7 hours in to the Jam. My plan was to have a game that has 3 enemy types, each with attack, move and die animations. I have completed no enemy animations. Doesn't matter as I got a few player animations and a Dark Souls-like Death animation. This was my first time really working with animations so there are a few hitbox issues and maybe some flickering but will be better next time.

Things that did not get done:
- a few more enemy types
- more weapons (honestly I ran out of ideas, as I didn't have any to start with).
- pause menu (i am so sorry).
- animations
- sound effects and background music

SORRY FOR WALL OF TEXT, got excited.
